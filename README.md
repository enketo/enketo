# Enketo

Enketo is an open source project that produces web form software for the [ODK ecosystem](https://getodk.org).

## Packages

This is the Enketo web forms monorepo. See more details on each package in its corresponding README file:

-   [Enketo Core](./packages/enketo-core): Enketo's web form engine, intended for embedding in a web application
-   [Enketo Express](./packages/enketo-express): Enketo's integrated web application, embedding Enketo Core and providing integration with OpenRosa form servers
-   [Enketo Transformer](./packages/enketo-transformer): used by Enketo to transform [XForms](https://getodk.github.io/xforms-spec/) into the format consumed by Enketo Core
-   [OpenRosa XPath Evaluator](./packages/openrosa-xpath-evaluator): Enketo's implementation of the OpenRosa XPath extensions, used in Enketo Core
-   [Enketo Transformer Web (example)](./examples/enketo-transformer-web): example app demonstrating client-side usage of Enketo Transformer

## Project status

Enketo was initiated in 2009 by Martijn van de Rijdt as a web-based alternative or complement to [ODK Collect](https://docs.getodk.org/collect-intro/). It has become a core component of the ODK ecosystem and been adopted by several organizations beyond that ecosystem.

Since 2021, Enketo has been maintained by the [ODK team](https://getodk.org/about/team.html). The ODK team's goals have been to increase alignment with ODK Collect, improve error messages to help users get out of bad states and improve long-term maintainability by modernizing the code base, removing code duplication, and simplifying state mutation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ODK team will transition out of being primary maintainers of Enketo by the end of 2024. Kobo will then take on primary maintainership.

Please use the issues for discussion (but we will also continue to respond on the [ODK forum](https://forum.getodk.org/)).

## Using Enketo in your system

There are two major ways to use Enketo: embedding the client-side [Enketo Core](./packages/enketo-core) library in a broader frontend or using the [Enketo Express](./packages/enketo-express) service through [its APIs](https://enketo.org/develop/api/). Which you choose depends on the functionality you what to implement in your host app (for example, Enketo Core doesn't provide offline caching of in-progress submissions, form transformation, or form URL management) and whether or not you already implement the OpenRosa APIs.

### Using Enketo Core

To use Enketo Core, see [its README](./packages/enketo-core#usage-as-a-library).

### Using Enketo Express

The recommended way to run Enketo Express is using Docker. We publish a [minimal image](https://github.com/enketo/enketo/pkgs/container/enketo) which builds Enketo Express using the default configuration and then launches it. You will need to supply a configuration appropriate for your environment which must set at least the "linked form and data server", "api key", and secrets. You will also need to run `redis` and make sure that Enketo Express can talk to both the `redis` database(s) and a form server. See a simple example `docker-compose` file for running a full platform on a single host with [ODK Central](https://github.com/getodk/central/blob/master/docker-compose.yml). Another common configuration is to run Enketo Express on a separate host. Learn more about configuring Enketo Express [in its README](./packages/enketo-express).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you used the Enketo Express Docker image [from before the monorepo migration](https://github.com/enketo/enketo-express/blob/master/Dockerfile), you will need to make adjustments:
>
> -   Paths have changed. The working directory was previously the Enketo Express root so you would put your config at `config/config.json`. Now it is the Enketo monorepo root so your config must go to `packages/enketo-express/config/config.json`.
> -   Previous versions generated and templated in secrets using a Python script. If you need a templated configuration, you need to manage that yourself in your deployment infrastructure.
> -   Previous versions installed `pm2` and started Enketo Express with it.

## Development

In short:

```sh
## Install & copy config
yarn install
cp packages/enketo-express/config/default-config.json packages/enketo-express/config/config.json

## Optionally, start docker redis. No action required if redis is installed on host.
docker run --rm -dit --name enketo-redis --publish 6379:6379 --publish 6380:6379 redis
export TEST_REDIS_MAIN_PORT=6379

## Watch everything (from workspace's root)
yarn watch # see http://localhost:8005/preview?xform=http://localhost:3000/all-widgets.xml
```

## License

See each package for its licence.

Additionally, any product that uses enketo-core is required to have a "Powered by Enketo" footer, according to the specifications below, on all screens in which enketo-core or parts thereof, are used, unless explicity exempted from this requirement by Enketo LLC in writing. Partners and sponsors of the Enketo Project, listed on [https://enketo.org/about/sponsors/](https://enketo.org/about/sponsors/) are exempted from this requirements and so are contributors listed in [package.json](https://github.com/enketo/enketo-core/blob/master/package.json).

The aim of this requirement is to force adopters to give something back to the Enketo project, by at least spreading the word and thereby encouraging further adoption.

Specifications:

1. The word "Enketo" is displayed using Enketo's logo.
2. The minimum font-size of "Powered by" is 12 points.
3. The minimum height of the Enketo logo matches the font-size used.
4. The Enketo logo is hyperlinked to https://enketo.org
