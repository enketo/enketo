# Developing Enketo with KoboToolbox

This document provides a step-by-step guide to create a testing and development environment for Enketo using KoboToolbox's development environment as the connected OpenRosa server.

This environment leverages the existing setup of `kobo-install` with its configurations as a base for connecting the local Enketo instance to KoboToolbox as a replacement for its existing Enketo instance.

## Prerequisites

-   Docker and Docker Compose installed
-   Node.js and Yarn (versions specified in `package.json`)
-   Git
-   `make` utility (`sudo apt install build-essential` on Linux)

## Step 1: Setup KoboToolbox Development Environment

1. Follow the [kobo-install documentation](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobo-install) to set up a local instance of KoboToolbox
2. Ensure KoboToolbox is running and accessible

## Step 2: Setup Enketo Development Environment

1. Clone Enketo's repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/enketo/enketo.git
    cd enketo
    ```

2. Verify Node.js and Yarn versions match those specified in `package.json`

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Step 3: Configure Enketo

1. Create the configuration file:

    ```bash
    cp ./packages/enketo-express/config/default-config.json ./packages/enketo-express/config/config.json
    ```

2. Edit `./packages/enketo-express/config/config.json` and update the following sections:

    **App Name:**

    ```json
    {
        "app name": "Enketo KoboToolbox Development Environment"
    }
    ```

    > **Note:** The specified name will be displayed in Enketo's homepage and is useful to verify if the running version accessible through `ee.kobo.local` is the correct one.

    **Server Configuration:**

    ```json
    {
        "linked form and data server": {
            "name": "KoboToolbox",
            "api key": "enketorules",
            "server url": "",
            "legacy formhub": false,
            "authentication": {
                "type": "basic",
                "allow insecure transport": "false"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    > **Note:** The empty `server url` allows Enketo to connect to the local server without specifying a URL.

## Step 4: Configure KoboToolbox

1. Navigate to your KoboToolbox installation directory:

    ```bash
    cd kobo-install
    ```

2. Create or edit `docker-compose.frontend.custom.yml`:

    ```yml
    services:
        kpi:
            environment:
                - ENKETO_API_KEY=enketorules

        nginx:
            extra_hosts:
                - enketo_express:<YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS>
    ```

    > **Note:** This configuration remaps `ee.kobo.local` from the Enketo instance setup by kobo-install to your local Enketo development instance.

3. Replace `<YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS>` with your actual local IP address:

    - **Linux/macOS:** `ip addr show` or `ifconfig`
    - **Windows:** `ipconfig`

    > **Important:** Use your local IP address instead of `localhost` to ensure proper communication between KoboToolbox containers and your Enketo running locally.

4. Ensure the `ENKETO_API_KEY` matches the API key in your Enketo configuration (`enketorules`).

5. Recreate the nginx container:
    ```bash
    ./run.py -cf up -d --force-recreate nginx
    ```

## Step 5: Start the Development Environment

### Start KoboToolbox:

```bash
cd kobo-install
./run.py
```

### Start Enketo (in development mode):

```bash
cd enketo
yarn workspace enketo-express start
# or for watch mode with auto-reload:
yarn workspace enketo-express watch
```

## Step 6: Access and Test

### URLs:

-   **KoboToolbox:** `http://kf.kobo.local` (or your configured address)
-   **Enketo:** `http://localhost:8005` and `http://ee.kobo.local`: Enketo's homepage should display the configured app name.

### Testing the Integration:

1. **Login to KoboToolbox** and create a user account
2. **Create a new project** with a form
3. **Deploy your project**
4. **Navigate to:** Project â†’ Form section
5. **Click "Open"** to launch the form in your local Enketo instance

The form should now be displayed by your local Enketo instance, allowing you to test and develop features.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

-   **Access denied for audio/video:** For local development, you may need to set specific permissions on Chrome (or your browser of choice) to allow access to audio/video from the unsafe development source. You can do that on Chrome by navigating to (`chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`) and adding your local Enketo URL (e.g., `http://ee.kobo.local`).
-   **Connection refused:** Verify that both services are running and the IP address is correct
-   **API key mismatch:** Ensure the `ENKETO_API_KEY` matches in both configurations
-   **Port conflicts:** Check that port 8005 is available for Enketo

**Happy developing!**
