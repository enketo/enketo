# Developing Enketo with KoboToolbox

This document provides a step-by-step guide to create a testing and development environment for Enketo using KoboToolbox's development environment as the connected OpenRosa server.

This environment leverages the existing setup of `kobo-install` with its configurations as a base for connecting the local Enketo instance to KoboToolbox as a replacement for its existing Enketo instance.

## Prerequisites

-   Docker and Docker Compose installed
-   Node.js and Yarn (versions specified in `package.json`)
-   Git
-   `make` utility (`sudo apt install build-essential` on Linux)

## Step 1: Setup KoboToolbox Development Environment

1. Follow the [kobo-install documentation](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobo-install) to set up a local instance of KoboToolbox
2. Ensure KoboToolbox is running and accessible

## Step 2: Setup Enketo Development Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enketo/enketo.git
cd enketo
node -v # should be 20.x.x or 22.x.x, see package.json
yarn -v # should be >= 1.22.22 but not 2.x.x, see package.json
yarn install
```

## Step 3: Configure Enketo

1. Create the configuration file:

    ```bash
    cp ./packages/enketo-express/config/default-config.json ./packages/enketo-express/config/config.json
    ```

2. Edit `./packages/enketo-express/config/config.json` and update the following sections:
    - `app name`: will be displayed in Enketo's homepage and is useful to verify if the running version accessible through `ee.kobo.local` is the correct one.
    - `server url`: empty value allows Enketo to connect to the local server without specifying a URL.
    - example:
        ```json
        {
            "app name": "Enketo KoboToolbox Development Environment",
            ...
            "linked form and data server": {
                "name": "KoboToolbox",
                "api key": "enketorules",
                "server url": "",
                "legacy formhub": false,
                "authentication": {
                    "type": "basic",
                    "allow insecure transport": "false"
                }
            },
            ...
        }
        ```

## Step 4: Configure KoboToolbox

1.  Navigate to your KoboToolbox installation directory:

    ```bash
    cd kobo-docker
    ```

2.  Create or edit `docker-compose.frontend.custom.yml`:

    > _Note:_ This file is prefered over `docker-compose.frontend.override.yml` since the latter is managed by `kobo-install` and will be overwritten. Using the former allows you to customize the frontend configuration without losing changes during updates.

        ```yml
        services:
            kpi:
                environment:
                    - ENKETO_API_KEY=enketorules

            nginx:
                extra_hosts:
                    - enketo_express:<YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS>
        ```

        > **Note:** This configuration remaps `ee.kobo.local` from the Enketo instance setup by kobo-install to your local Enketo development instance.

3.  Replace `<YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS>` with your actual local IP address:

    -   **Linux/macOS:** `ip addr` or `ifconfig`
    -   **Windows:** `ipconfig`

    > **Important:** Use your local IP address instead of `localhost` to ensure proper communication between KoboToolbox containers and your Enketo running locally.

4.  Ensure the `ENKETO_API_KEY` matches the API key in your Enketo configuration (`enketorules`).

5.  Recreate the nginx container:
    ```bash
    ./run.py -cf up -d --force-recreate nginx
    ```

## Step 5: Start the Development Environment

The order of starting the services is important to ensure that services are available before connections are made.

1.  Start KoboToolbox Backend:

    ```bash
    cd kobo-install
    ./run.py -cb up -d
    ```

    > Note: This will start the _redis_ service as well, which is needed by Enketo.

2.  Start Enketo development environment :

    ```bash
    cd enketo
    yarn watch
    ```

    > Note: This will make Enketo server available, which is needed when getting Kobotoolbox frontend up.

3.  Start KoboToolbox Frontend:

        ```bash
        cd kobo-install
        ./run.py -cf up -d
        ```

Optionally, you can follow the logs for Kobotoolbox:

```bash
./run.py -cf logs -f
```

## Step 6: Access and Test

### URLs:

-   **KoboToolbox:** `http://kf.kobo.local` (or your configured address)
-   **Enketo:** `http://localhost:8005` and `http://ee.kobo.local`: Enketo's homepage should display the configured app name.

### Testing the Integration:

1. **Login to KoboToolbox** (Create a user account if needed. Refer to KoboToolbox documentation for details)
2. **Create a new project**
3. **Deploy your project**
4. **Navigate to:** Project â†’ Form section
5. **Click "Preview" (the eye icon)** To open a preview of the form inside of KoboToolbox
6. **Click "Open"** to launch the form in your local Enketo instance ready to send submissions

The form should now be displayed by your local Enketo instance, allowing you to test and develop features.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

-   **Access denied for audio/video:** For local development, you may need to set specific permissions on Chrome (or your browser of choice) to allow access to audio/video from the unsafe development source. You can do that on Chrome by navigating to (`chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`) and adding your local Enketo URL (e.g., `http://ee.kobo.local`).
-   **Connection refused:** Verify that both services are running and the IP address is correct
-   **API key mismatch:** Ensure the `ENKETO_API_KEY` matches in both configurations
-   **Port conflicts:** Check that port 8005 is available for Enketo
-   **Enketo not starting:** Ensure that Kobotoolbox backend is running and that the `docker-compose.frontend.custom.yml` is correctly configured
-   **KoboToolbox not starting:** Verify that Enketo is running and the sequence of starting services is followed correctly

**Happy developing!**
