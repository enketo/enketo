# Openrosa XPath Evaluator

Wrapper for browsers' XPath evaluator with added support for OpenRosa extensions.

For more info on extended XPath expressions/bindings supported by XForms/OpenRosa/OpenDataKit (ODK) see:

-   [ODK XForm Specification](https://getodk.github.io/xforms-spec/)

# Installation

## yarn

    yarn add openrosa-xpath-evaluator

## npm

    npm install --save openrosa-xpath-evaluator

# Use

## Initialisation

```js
const orxe = require('openrosa-xpath-evaluator');
const evaluate = orxe();
```

## Querying

```js
var result = evaluate(
    '//ul/li/text()', // XPath expression
    document, // context node
    null, // namespace resolver
    XPathResult.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE
);

// loop through results
for (var i = 0; i < result.snapshotLength; i++) {
    var node = result.snapshotItem(i);
    alert(node.nodeValue);
}
```

# Dependencies

This library has no explicit dependencies, but expects various DOM & XPath-related values to be supplied by the browser (`Element`, `Node`, `XPathResult` etc.).

To use the [ODK `digest()` function](https://getodk.github.io/xforms-spec/#fn:digest), you'll need to add [`node-forge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-forge) to your project.

# Development

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for developing Openrosa XPath Evaluator through Enketo Express.

# Known limitations

-   namespace:: axis is not supported (but it might work in your browser if you're lucky)
-   xpath variables (`$var`) are not supported

# Not implemented

The following XPath/ODK/OpenRosa functions are not implemented in this library, but may still work depending on your usage.

## XPath 1.0 functions

-   instance()
-   current()

## ODK functions

-   pulldata()
-   jr:choice-name()
-   jr:itext()
-   indexed-repeat()

# TODO

-   arrange source code, e.g. `src/core` and `src/openrosa`
