        # The intent here is to check for "not prefixed". The reason to even have
        # that intent in the first place is that there's no clear, proscribed way
        # to get a substring (any substring), or do substring replacement in GitHub
        # Actions syntax. So it is not possible to derive an unprefixed tag from
        # a tag prefixed `enketo-express/`, which we had originally intended to do.
        #
        # So the workaround is "don't prefix enketo-express releases". The logic
        # to check "not prefixed" is also not possible, for the same underlying
        # reason: to check "not prefixed", we'd want to know if the tag name has
        # a slash. We can't know that, because `github.ref` always has slashes,
        # i.e. `refs/tags/unprefixed-tag-name`.
        #
        # So the next workaround is to enumerate all of the known prefixes we do
        # not want to match.
        #
        # And then the syntax gets weird, because we're writing code, in the
        # GitHub Actions DSL, within a string in YAML syntax. "Not" in GHA DSL
        # is predictably expressed with `!`, which evidently has special meaning
        # in YAML... which in turn causes a YAML syntax error at `,`.
        #
        # So then the GHA-DSL-code-in-YAML-string must be explicitly quoted. The
        # actual GHA-DSL-code-in-YAML-string also contains quoted strings, and
        # those quotes must not conflict. Double quotes also produces a syntax
        # error, this time in the GHA DSL. Backslashes are ostensibly the correct
        # mechanism to escape double quotes, but not single quotes: they are also
        # a syntax error (only detectable by running the Action on GitHub).
        #
        # No, to escape single quotes in GHA-DSL-code-in-YAML-string, you must use
        # double-single-quotes-within-single-quotes. So that is what we've got in
        # this line here.
        #
        # That's not all. For VSCode users: if you need to edit this file, to save
        # you must call the "File: Save without Formatting" command, lest it be
        # reformatted with invalid double quotes.
